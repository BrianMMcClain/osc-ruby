= An OSC client for Ruby

http://opensoundcontrol.org/

== GOAL

I've used the OSC gem originally created by Tadayoshi Funaba and wanted to update it for ruby 1.9 compatibility.  I'm also writing rspec tests for this library to allow others to more easily understand/update the code.  It's getting closer to awesome every day...
